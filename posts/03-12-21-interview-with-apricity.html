<h3>You say that working throughout COVID has been a blessing to you and your career, can you elaborate on that? If it weren’t for your success does the ‘work-from-home’ model go well with your personality/work style?</h3>
<p>I know that it has been a tremendously difficult time for everyone around the world due to the pandemic.  I would never want to down play that.  However , it gave me the time and an opportunity to work on music and work with people I may not have met otherwise  Doors had opened up since other artists had cancelled projects.The work from home style is a fit for me.  Throughout my working career - outside of music , I have had that model.  I am very disciplined </p>

<h3>What are your top 5 things to do, and top 5 things not to do for someone who is trying to break into doing music full time?
</h3>
<p>I am still very new in this scene so I am learning as I go.

Perseverance , dedication , be open and creative, watch other artists are 5 things I do.

Don’t be negative.  Do not over commit yourself or rush yourself. Stay away from negative energy and don’t give up :-)</p>

<h3>How instrumental has social media been in promoting your music, especially since the world shifted into this ‘new normal’? </h3>
<p>Social media in this day and age, is a huge part of everything in life. It is a great marketing tool and a way to reach people all over the world. You can make connections quickly. It is a great way to reach out to your fans, especially during this year with the Pandemic. Online concerts, virtual meetings…huge part of this year. Social Media platforms have given musicians more control over the distribution of their music I do believe. Whether this is going to become the way the industry is going…time will tell. I believe we have to be adaptable to be successful.</p>

<h3>Are you a fan of TikTok? Do you see your music breaking into that platform, and if you could choose a TikTok niche to have your music be the soundtrack to, which would it be?</h3>
<p>I am fairly new to Tik Tok but again it is a terrific marketing tool. As for a niche..  I’d have to say dancing though I have had lip syncing done to the song already !</p>

<h3>Your voice is so powerful, I can’t wait to hear more...is there any music coming out soon we should keep an eye out for?</h3>
<p>Thank you for the compliment.  I owe that to Thomas McKay my producer as he always pushes to strive for your best I am coming out with my second single from my upcoming EP in a few weeks, The Fear.</p>

<h3>We feature a lot of up and coming artists on our blog, so do you have any favourites at the moment?</h3>
<p>Yes you have so much talent on your blog. Thanks for having me take a part in this ! AJR brothers and Between Friends caught my attention.</p>

<h3>Where do you see yourself in 5 years professionally?</h3>
<p>I see myself continuing along this path. I am hoping I will be able to successfully tour, depending on the world situation. What matters is to be happy in what you are doing and to continue to grow and learn I have a willingness and commitment to improve myself. I’d like to be seen as someone with deep roots in the music industry, and I know that’s something that I’ll have an opportunity to do here and continue.</p>
